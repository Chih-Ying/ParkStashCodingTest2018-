Testing tasts: 

1. Create a native iOS Mobile App using Swift or Objective C and Xcode, 
with a Side menu (see attached Mockup) and map as home screen. 
Take a set of dummy data representing locations on map with latitude and longitude. 
Show these locations on map when a user opens the app using appropriate marker. 

2. Create a button to pin a new location searched on map by a user. 
Add this new location to your set of dummy data and it should show up the next time user starts the app.
